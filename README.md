Speed and safety! In this era, the two most important factors in any application are
the rapid transfer of data between backend, user interface, and security. React Native
has been used to create hybrid apps with an easy-to-use interface.

I used this cross-platform for mobile devices to design my “End-to-End Encrypted
Voice Calling App for Smartphones”, which has the slogan “Type One, Use
Everywhere”.

The primary purpose of the app is to create a very secure app. This uses an
end-to-end encryption method and an open source signal protocol library to create a
voice communication application using different encryption algorithms.

In addition, in the design of the application, not only is it planned to transfer security
data in the internet environment, but I have planned to open the application with a
face print to increase the user's security in the real world with the ML kit from
Google.

While I traveled researching how to build and build this app, I learned the following;
Although the cryptography branch is not a broad one, its importance is very great.
Encryption algorithms consist of the same concepts on their basis. With change, the
performance of algorithms can be improved in terms of security or speed.

There are different encryption algorithms according to my research and the
conclusion that I came to in my design, depending on the application that will be
designed and the environment in which the application will operate, the encryption
algorithm used will play a major role in the performance of the application.

Creating something from scratch isn't always a good idea, so ready-made open
source libraries - like the Signal Protocol Library - that exist make it easier for us as a
cryptographic designer and take Internet security to a higher level.

Encryption algorithms can and should be combined with current and new
technologies such as React Native to create modern high-performance applications.

As a result, the "end-to-end encrypted voice calling application for smartphones" was
designed using the React Native Cross platform and signal protocol. SQLite
Database and Firebase Cloud were used in the database design. It was decided to use
the Google ML kit firebase library of machine learning for face recognition and the
RSA algorithm to store the obtained data in a safe way.

We can see how easy it is to implement the end-to-end encryption method. Internet
security and the security of people's personal information are of great importance,
and people must be seriously aware of this problem, so that rulers and technology
companies are forced to use this method.
